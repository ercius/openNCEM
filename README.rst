Components
==========

The openNCEM collection comes with different components, described below.

**ncempy**
    openNCEM's python package to provide various algorithms and routines to process or simulate images.


**tools**
    The tools build leveraging the algorithms and routines provided in the libraries/packages. They are subordered by the different problems they address.


**nionswift_plugin**
    A plugin for [Nion Swift](http://nion.com/swift) that adds openNCEM's ``ser``, ``emd``, and Velox file import capabilities (for images only, spectrum images are not currently supported). 

Commands
========

**ncem2png**
    Extracts a PNG file from the data in a SER, DM3, or DM4 file. For 3D and 4D
    files, it tries to extract an image from the middle of the third and forth
    dimension.
